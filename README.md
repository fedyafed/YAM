[![](https://jitpack.io/v/fedyafed/YAM.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#fedyafed/YAM)

## Goals
### Implement basic logic of minesweeper
1. Game field may have non-grid view (triangular for ex.)
2. Every cell have states - open and closed, contains mines or not
3. Cell can contain only one mine.
4. Game field should know which cells are near to current one.
5. User can open any closed cell, mark cell as containing mine, start new game.
6. Mines are generated after first click.
